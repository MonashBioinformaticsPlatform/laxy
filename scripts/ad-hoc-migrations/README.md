This directory contains various ad-hoc data migration scripts that 
don't necessarily make sense to exist under the global 
`laxy_backend/migrations` scheme. 

You probably don't need to run these ! Generally these will be migrations
required for very specific scenarios in legacy installations but aren't
required migrations for new installations. They largely serve as examples that can be adapted by administrators
to accommodate changes to pipeline versions or web frontend requirements.
