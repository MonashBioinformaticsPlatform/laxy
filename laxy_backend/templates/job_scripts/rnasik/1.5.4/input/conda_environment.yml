# When the the first line above is valid JSON, it is used to retrieve a pre-generated conda environment
# rather than installing this conda_environment.yml. For large environments this is faster, and generally
# aids reproducibility.
---
# This environment contains the minimal packages required without listing automatically installed
# dependencies or specific versions.
# It can be used as a template for building an environment with a specific version of a pipeline,
# which is then exported as `conda env export >conda_environment.yml`
#
# (We maintain this simplified environment file since while keeping the output of `conda env export`
#  is great for reproducible environments it makes it difficult to identify just the required
#  core packages when all their implicit dependencies are also listed)
#
# Packages here should generally be unversioned, unless a specific version is known to be required.
