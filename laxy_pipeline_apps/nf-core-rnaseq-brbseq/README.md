# nf-core-rnaseq with BRB-seq demultiplexing pipeline for Laxy

A Laxy wrapper for https://nf-co.re/rnaseq and https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/fqdemux

Frontend files currently reside in `laxy_frontend/src/components/pipelines/nf-core-rnaseq-brbseq`, but should be be moved to this Django app, or a corresponding `npm` package (WIP !).
